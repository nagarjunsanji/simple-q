/*
Factory Pattern
Factory pattern abstracts the object creation.

Factory pattern is another class-based creational pattern. In this, we provide a generic interface that delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.
This pattern is frequently used when we need to manage or manipulate collections of objects that are different yet have many similar characteristics.
In this example, we create a factory class named BallFactory that has a method that takes in parameters, and, depending on the parameters, it delegates the object instantiation responsibility to the respective class. If the type parameter is "football" or "soccer" object instantiation is handled by Football class, but if it is "basketball" object instantiation is handled by Basketball class.

class BallFactory {
  constructor() {
    this.createBall = function (type) {
      let ball;
      if (type === 'football' || type === 'soccer') {
        ball = new Football();
      }
      else if (type === 'basketball') {
        ball = new Basketball();
      }

      ball.roll = function () {
        return `The ${this._type} is rolling.`;
      };

      return ball;
    };
  }
}

class Football {
  constructor() {
    this._type = 'football';
    this.kick = function () {
      return 'You kicked the football.';
    };
  }
}

class Basketball {
  constructor() {
    this._type = 'basketball';
    this.bounce = function () {
      return 'You bounced the basketball.';
    };
  }
}

// creating objects
const factory = new BallFactory();

const myFootball = factory.createBall('football');
const myBasketball = factory.createBall('basketball');

console.log(myFootball.roll()); // The football is rolling.
console.log(myBasketball.roll()); // The basketball is rolling.
console.log(myFootball.kick()); // You kicked the football.
console.log(myBasketball.bounce()); // You bounced the basketball.
